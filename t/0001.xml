    <t id="10001">Greetings Pilot,\n\nI am messaging you on behalf of the well-respected Teladi Trade Guild. I would personally like to thank you for subscribing to our new initiative, Finance Hub.\n\nTo capitalise on sector space and those living free on our stations, we've developed a module that will allow you to collect taxes from your workforce and other factions that own stations in sectors under your jurisdiction.\n\nThis initiative has already been incredibly successful, and the other factions are already implementing it into their networks; unfortunately, this means you will have to pay taxes for stations built in other factions' sectors. Please ensure your account has sufficient balance to pay these, as we would hate to see your reputation with these factions decline.\n\nOur research team have found that setting taxes low will encrouage new citizens to join your workforce. They also found setting them high sent members of your workforce looking for work elsewhere!\n\nI have taken the liberty of configuring the default values on the tax module to get you started.\n\nGood profits to you,\nmschf</t>
